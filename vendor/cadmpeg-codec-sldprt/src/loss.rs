//! Stable loss vocabulary for `.sldprt` decoding.
//!
//! Every fallback, approximation, and drop the decoder reports carries a
//! stable machine-readable code from [`SldprtLossCode`]. Codes are the gating
//! surface: harness oracles and downstream tooling key on them, never on the
//! human-readable message text, so a reworded message is not a contract change
//! and a new drop path without a code does not compile.
//!
//! [`SldprtLossCode::note`] is the single practical construction path for a
//! decode-time [`LossNote`] in this crate: it fixes the loss category and
//! severity from the code so the two cannot drift apart across sites, and it
//! leaves only the per-instance message to the caller.
